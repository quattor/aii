=head1 Kickstart Generator

This document describes AII's Kickstart generator.

=head2 SYNOPSIS

This AII component generates a Kickstart for installing SL 3 and 4. It
must be called from aii-shellfe 2 or higher.

=head2 IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AII 1.X

Now it is possible to define a correct Pan structure for AII
plug-ins. This means that old strings, with long or boolean semantics
have been converted to real long and boolean types.

=head2 RESOURCES

All these paths are relative to /system/aii/osinstall/ks.

=over 4

=item * ackurl : absolute URI

The absolute URL where the aii-installack.cgi script is located. This
script will change the PXE state for the node from network boot
("install") to local boot ("boot"). This field is set automatically
using the variables AII_ACK_SRV and AII_ACK_CGI.

=item * acklist : absolute URI[]

An alternative to ackurl, allowing the use of more than one bootservers.
If acklist is set, then ackurl is not used.

=item * auth : string[]

List of options for authentication. Defaults to ("enableshadow", "enablemd5").
i.e. enable shadow passwords and MD5 hashing.

=item * booloader_location : string

The location of the bootloader. Valid values are "mbr", "partition"
and "none". Defaults to "mbr".

=item * booloader_append ? string

String to add in an "--append" option for the bootloader

=item * clearmbr : boolean

Whether the disk's master boot record (MBR) should be cleared when
installing the node. Defaults to true.

=item * clearpart ? string[]

List of devices whose partitions must be cleared before proceeding
with the installation.

=item * driverdisk ? absoluteURI

URL for any additional drivers that might be needed during the
installation.

=item * email_success : boolean

Whether an e-mail should be sent to the system administrator upon a
successful installation. Defaults to false.

=item * installnumber ? string

Installation number used for support purposes.

=item * installtype : string

A string containing the type of installation and the location of the
distribution on the Kickstart server. This field will be derived by
AII on later versions.

=item * keyboard : string

The preferred keyboard layout for the node. Defaults to "us".

=item * lang : string

The language used during the installation process. Defaults to
"en_US.UTF-8".

=item * langsupport : string[]

List of languages to be installed during this phase. If you use
several languages, you must mark the entry for the default one with
'--default=<your_lang>'.

=item * mouse : string

The mouse type for the system. Defaults to "none".

=item * bootproto : string

Protocol for configuring the network interface. It must be either
"dhcp" or "static".

=item * node_profile : absoluteURI

URL where the profile can be fetched. On systems using CCM (most of
them!) this should be the same value as of
C</software/components/ccm/profile>.

=item * osinstall_protocol : string

Protocol for the installation. It must be either HTTP, HTTPS, NFS or
FTP.

=item * ignoredisk ? string[]

List of devices that Anaconda will have to skip during the
installation.

=item * packages : string[]

List of packages to be installed before the reboot.

=item * pre_install_script, post_install_script, post_reboot_script ? absoluteURI

URLs where the user-specific scripts can be fetched from. Please note
that these scripts are not hooks!

=item * timezone : string

Your local timezone, e.g: Europe/Madrid.

=item * selinux : string

Enable SELinux on your system. Must be one of "disabled", "enforcing"
or "permissive".

=item * disable_service ? string[]

List of services to be disabled before the reboot, in order to avoid
nasty behaviour such as, f.i, grabbing lots of RPMs from CERN because
of Yum.

=item * base_packages ? string[]

Base packages needed for a Quattor client to run (CCM, NCM etc.). These
packages will be installed during the post reboot phase.

=item * extra_packages ? string[]

List of additional packages needed to have the node running, before
the SPMA actually runs. For instance, Xen kernels or special mkinitrd
packages should be placed here. These packages are installed by
the post-install script, before rebooting.

=item * disabled_repos ? string[]

List of Yum repositories that should be disabled during the C<%post>
phase.  Useful on RH 5 systems, where Yum can't skip repositories that
need some additional configurations.

It accepts wildcards, as Yum does.

=item * packages_args ? string[]

List of switches to add to the kickstart "%packages" line.
Defaults to "--resolvedeps --ignoremissing"; you probably
want to keep those in the list.

=item * end_script : string

Closing tag used for Kickstart scripts (usually either empty or "%end"). Early
Anaconda versions did not have such a closing tag. Later the use of %end became
optional, and recent Anaconda releases made it mandatory.

=item * part_label: boolean

If set to true, then the "part" stanzas in the kickstart configuration will
have a "--label" option to set the label of the file system.

=item * firewall
