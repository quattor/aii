Plugin to allow customizing the kickstart script from templates. It allows
doing various early setup tasks before the host profile is downloaded and
the full-featured ncm components would become usable. The supported
operations are:

- Create config files with a given content
- Install additional packages (only if used as a post-reboot hook)
- Run arbitrary commands

If more than one kind of operations are requested, they are performed in
the above order. The hook may be invoked multiple times if you need even
greater control over the order of events.

Example use case:

include { "quattor/aii/custom/config" };

"/system/aii/hooks/post_reboot" = push(nlist(
	"module", "custom",
	"files", nlist(
		escape("/etc/some_config_file"), nlist(
			"contents", "config file contents"
		),
	),
	"packages", list("name_of_package"),
	"commands", list(
		nlist("command", "ls -lR /dev"),
	),
));
